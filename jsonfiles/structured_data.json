    "Introduction": {
      "main_content": "Microgravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravityâa fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular processes on Earth. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival. Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity conditions. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases. This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health."

    "Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System": {
      "Alterations in Immune Cells": "Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the development, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the bodyâs defenses in space environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells, show impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore, an imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair) macrophages disrupts the immune systemâs ability to handle infections and repair tissues. Dendritic cells, pivotal in T lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation, are also adversely affected. Key molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show reduced expression, diminishing dendritic cell functionality. Notably, brief exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic cell activity; however, this effect is not sustained over the long term. Neutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced functionality, impairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively. B lymphocytes, responsible for humoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly, natural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity, limiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells (Figure 1).",
      "Impact on T Cells": "Microgravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin Aâa standard activator of resting T cellsârevealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71 (iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction. CD4+ T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL-2 and IFN-Î³, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8+ T cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions, while CD8+ cells require longer exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments. Cytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells exhibit decreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansion, and IFN-Î³, crucial for macrophage activation and antiviral defense. These deficiencies indicate a reduced capacity of T cells to coordinate and amplify immune responses. Apoptosis of T cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset of late apoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage apoptosis and a reduction in early-stage apoptosis, indicating a faster progression through apoptotic pathways compared to controls under normal gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression of the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which regulates apoptosis through external signals (Figure 1).",
      "Impact on Key Molecular Pathways": "At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including RAS, ERK, and NF-ÎºB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF-ÎºB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses. Research on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, including the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the regulation of key proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-ÎºB (a regulator of immune responses and inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in programmed cell death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types. In cell lines from breast (MCF-7), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers, microgravity-induced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene expression, particularly in molecules like E-cadherin (important for cell adhesion and tumor invasion suppression), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin (a protein associated with epithelialâmesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby affecting tumor proliferation and dissemination."

    "Impact on Cancer Biology": {
      "Cancer Stem Cells": "The study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions provides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with profound implications for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs, characterized by their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities, contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, and metastasis. In cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are identified using specific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed analysis. Under simulated microgravity, these cells exhibit significant changes in morphology and growth patterns, including the formation of multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic in vivo tumor organization, offering a robust model for studying the effects of microgravity on tumor biology. Exposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased apoptosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting a shift toward differentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance, potentially enhancing their susceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer, simulated microgravity has been linked to increased expression of specific markers, reflecting alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These changes can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological treatments (Figure 2). Microgravity modulates apoptosis, a key defense against abnormal cell proliferation. Many cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis due to altered mechanical forces, while some acquire stem-like properties, enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy resistance. Microgravity also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), which mimic solid tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, suggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity downregulates adhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin, vinculin, paxillin), weakening cellâcell interactions and potentially enhancing metastatic potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing radiation exacerbates DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells, highlighting the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights into cancer treatment. Simulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV) and random positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real microgravity (r-Âµg) but with some differences. High-energy radiation with high linear energy transfer (high LET) increases genomic instability and mutation risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations. In gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality, compromising immunosurveillance and hindering cancer detection. Recent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting NF-ÎºB, reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to limit tumor growth through reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway may slow tumor growth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to therapies, become more vulnerable under microgravity, which also alters extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA content, opening opportunities for new biomarkers and targeted therapies. The mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays a crucial role in cellular responses to microgravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion, offering potential therapeutic benefits, but these effects are ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure and adhesion stability in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure, but may enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness. At the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and invasiveness. This effect depends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead to resistance or diminished responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may limit tumor aggressiveness but could pose a structural disadvantage for healthy tissues during extended space missions.",
      "Thyroid Cancer": "Microgravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a unique experimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology, particularly thyroid cancer. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under conventional laboratory conditions. In microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and organize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and evaluating novel targeted therapies. Microgravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are critical for cell growth and proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity have demonstrated a tendency to adopt a less malignant phenotype. This suggests that microgravity conditions may induce favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of thyroid cancer. The findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize traditional oncology research approaches. They facilitate the identification of key cellular alterations in cancer pathogenesis and support the development of innovative therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive strategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed under microgravity."

    "Impacts on Tissues and Organ Systems": {
      "Microvascular Endothelial Cells": "Simulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells, which play a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. Under normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli to preserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity, significant alterations are observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, which delays the repair of damaged blood vessels. Reduced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine crucial for the inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and vascular repair capacity. Interestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a critical mediator for blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is linked to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its dysregulation can lead to pathological states, depending on the physiological context. Research on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on endothelial cell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, essential regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were exposed to simulated microgravity for up to 72 h using an RPM, which continuously rotates to nullify Earthâs gravitational vector. After 24 h, notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were observed, including a marked reduction in cell stiffness (Youngâs modulus) and viscosity. Specifically, cellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%, reaching critical levels with a 75% reduction after 72 h. This loss of rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external hemodynamic stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under simulated microgravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped, cells adopted a distinctly rounded phenotype after 24 h. The increase in circularityâmore than three times greater than that of control cellsâindicates significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could affect vascular permeability and the cellsâ ability to respond to mechanical stress over time. At the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with substantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis revealed a 65% reduction in actin filament levels and a 26% reduction in Î²-tubulin, a protein critical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings, showing discontinuities in cortical actin filaments and abnormal redistribution of microtubules, particularly around the nucleus. These results highlight impaired structural integrity and suggest that endothelial cells may have a compromised ability to respond to biomechanical stimuli (Figure 3). Endothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional spheroids, which closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D models are invaluable for studying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial function, enabling more physiologically relevant investigations compared to traditional 2D cultures. Collectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial physiology, influencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and vascular regulation. These insights have implications for diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory disorders. They underscore the need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during space missions and explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth.",
      "Hepatic Metabolism and Intestinal Homeostasis": "Microgravity, a defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations, profoundly impacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs, particularly the liver. Experimental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These include lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the disruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of exploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future human studies (Figure 3). In a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques developed mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltration. These hepatic changes were accompanied by a marked increase in plasma levels of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a key biomarker associated with metabolic disorders and lipid dysregulation. These results suggest that microgravity may induce hepatic lipotoxicity, a phenomenon previously documented in rodents but requiring further investigation in primates and humans to better understand its clinical relevance. At the molecular level, transcriptomic analyses of liver samples from macaques exposed to microgravity revealed overexpression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and downregulation of genes linked to the innate immune response. These molecular changes could impair the liverâs ability to manage metabolic stress, a critical function for maintaining long-term health. Additionally, disruptions in fatty acid metabolism were identified, potentially contributing to lipid dysregulation associated with metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Another noteworthy finding was the impact of microgravity on the gut microbiota, a key regulator of hepatic metabolism through the gutâliver axis. Macaques subjected to the head-down bed rest model exhibited intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and altered bile acid composition. These gut alterations were accompanied by elevated levels of stress hormones, suggesting systemic metabolic imbalance triggered by microgravity exposure. The effects of microgravity on liver function and metabolic homeostasis carry significant implications for space medicine. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor liver function and the gutâliver axis during prolonged space missions to mitigate potential health risks. Moreover, the metabolic changes observed in animal models provide valuable insights into terrestrial diseases such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This knowledge could contribute to the development of more effective treatments and innovative therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine, ultimately benefiting both astronauts and the general population.",
      "Bone Health and Mechanotransduction": "Microgravity profoundly impacts the mechanotransduction of human osteoblasts. Astronauts who spend prolonged periods in space experience accelerated bone mass loss, making the International Space Station (ISS) an ideal platform for studying the mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in zero-gravity conditions. In this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed, including the use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell spheroids. These advanced models enable researchers to investigate how the absence of mechanical loading affects bone cell maturation and mineralization. Studies have shown that microgravity decreases cell stiffness and reduces the levels of filamentous actin, a cytoskeletal component critical for maintaining cell tension and facilitating mechanotransduction. For example, experiments conducted on the ISS using automated microfluidic devices have provided valuable insights into the mechanical properties of human osteoblasts under microgravity conditions (Figure 3). Results from these experiments reveal that osteoblasts exposed to microgravity develop elongated protrusions compared to terrestrial samples, indicating a phenomenon referred to as âcellular softeningâ. This structural change correlates with a reduction in actin fiber density, consistent with findings from prior studies conducted under simulated microgravity. These structural and cytoskeletal alterations highlight disruptions in mechanotransduction, the process through which cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Without the constant gravitational forces present on Earth, osteoblasts lose the ability to maintain their tensional structure and perform optimally, contributing to the bone demineralization observed in astronauts. Further research has utilized three-dimensional spheroid models, which better replicate physiological conditions than traditional two-dimensional cell cultures. Collagen-encapsulated osteoblast spheroids subjected to controlled pressures under microgravity exhibited a reduction in the expression of key mechanosensitive proteins, such as Yes-associated protein (YAP). This suggests that microgravity disrupts mechanical signaling pathways critical for cellular regulation and bone homeostasis. Mechanotransduction is a crucial process by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli through interactions with the extracellular matrix. On Earth, proteins like YAP/TAZ translate mechanical forces into gene expression changes, modulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Under microgravity, the diminished activity of YAP/TAZ leads to varying outcomes in different cancers, such as reduced cell proliferation or increased invasiveness due to altered mechanosignaling. Understanding these differential responses could inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these vulnerabilities. Importantly, the application of compressive pressure partially restored YAP expression and increased pSMAD1/5/9 levels, demonstrating that biomechanical signals can reactivate essential molecular pathways, even under microgravity conditions. These findings underscore the potential of mechanical interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of microgravity on bone tissue. The implications of these studies are significant. They not only advance our understanding of how microgravity influences cellular biology but also pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to combat bone loss in both space environments and terrestrial patients with osteoporosis. Additionally, the creation of devices that simulate mechanical loads could benefit astronauts and individuals on Earth, emphasizing the critical role of biomechanics in maintaining bone health and cellular functionality in extreme conditions.",
      "Kidney Cells": "A recent study utilizing a microphysiological model of human renal proximal tubules investigated the effects of microgravity on the cellular ability to metabolize vitamin D and respond to human serum. The findings revealed that short-term exposure to microgravity does not significantly alter essential biochemical pathways in renal cells, indicating that fundamental processes remain intact. In this experiment, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were cultured in a microphysiological system and exposed to 2% human serum and vitamin D [25(OH)D3]. Biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured to assess cellular responses. Transcriptomic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing, monitored vitamin D metabolites and key genes involved in its metabolism, including CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and CYP3A5. Surprisingly, no significant differences in vitamin D metabolism were observed between microgravity and terrestrial conditions. However, exposure to human serum elicited similar metabolic responses in both environments, characterized by metabolic reprogramming, alterations in bioenergetic processes, and the presence of a pro-inflammatory extracellular environment. One of the most striking observations was the differential regulation of over 2000 genes after exposure to human serum, regardless of gravitational conditions. Affected pathways included the cell cycle, cytokineâcytokine receptor interactions, and chemokine signaling. Notably, a marked reduction in the expression of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism indicated diminished mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a metabolic shift in kidney cells. These findings imply that kidney cells, when exposed to human serum, redirect their metabolism toward a proliferation-focused strategy, reducing reliance on traditional energy pathways. Concurrently, significant changes in the extracellular environment were observed, indicative of tissue remodeling. This phenomenon was supported by the overexpression of genes related to the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN1) and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI), as well as enzymes such as metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), which are involved in remodeling and reorganizing the cellular environment. These adaptations may represent a cellular response to protein challenges in human serum or could signal underlying pathological processes. In addition to bioenergetic and extracellular matrix alterations, broader metabolic reorganization signals were detected. Elevated cytosolic cholesterol levels, inferred from the repression of genes regulated by the SREBF2 factor, reflected shifts in intracellular metabolic balance. While these effects were consistent across microgravity and terrestrial conditions, their significance lies in demonstrating how human serum, as an external stimulus, can drive profound cellular changes independently of gravity. These results reinforce the notion that certain fundamental processes in renal cells remain relatively stable under microgravity conditions during short-term exposures. However, they also highlight the need for further research into prolonged microgravity environments, where cellular adaptations may become more pronounced or clinically relevant. The implications of these discoveries are significant for both space exploration and terrestrial medicine. In the context of spaceflight, the findings provide critical insights into how kidneys might adapt to microgravity, ensuring that essential functions such as filtration and blood compound regulation are maintained during extended missions. On Earth, these studies offer valuable perspectives on how kidney cells respond to metabolic and protein stress, potentially informing the development of advanced therapies for kidney diseases (Figure 3).",
      "Reproductive System Ovarian Follicles and Egg Quality": "Simulated microgravity has provided valuable insights into how this unique environment impacts egg quality and ovarian follicle development. Ovarian follicles, which are critical for egg formation, rely on intricate interactions between granulosa cells and the egg to ensure proper maturation. However, the specific effects of microgravity on these interactions and the overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be understood. In an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were cultured in a simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle growth and survival rates were not significantly affected and remained comparable to those observed under normal gravity conditions, the quality of the eggs released was markedly reduced. Electron microscopy revealed alterations in the cellular structures responsible for communication between granulosa cells and the egg. These structural changes resulted in a loss of organization within the granulosa cells, disrupting the secretion of essential factors required for egg maturation. However, supplementing growth factors and antioxidants significantly improved egg quality, suggesting that the adverse effects of microgravity could be mitigated through targeted interventions. Further analysis of the eggs highlighted deficiencies in the distribution and density of cortical granules, structures vital for maturation. Additionally, there was a notable reduction in the number of eggs capable of releasing the first polar bodyâa critical process in egg development. These deficiencies were linked to increased oxidative stress levels, which further contributed to the decline in egg quality. Another key finding was the loss of polarity in granulosa cells, which inhibited the formation of cellular projections essential for interacting with the egg. This disruption impaired communication between granulosa cells and the egg, negatively affecting the maturation process. Moreover, microgravity altered the formation of microvilli in the egg, structures crucial for interaction with surrounding cells. Eggs cultured under microgravity conditions exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and size of microvilli, potentially limiting their ability to release factors essential for development (Figure 3).",
      "Cardiomyocyte Maturation and Functionality": "Simulated microgravity has been shown to significantly enhance the maturation and functionality of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. One of the most notable improvements observed under these conditions is mitochondrial biogenesis, a critical process for cellular maturation. Mitochondrial biogenesis enables cells to produce energy more efficiently, a key factor for the proper functioning of mature cardiomyocytes. Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial content, evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. These findings suggest that microgravity stimulates mitochondrial formation, improving the cellsâ capacity to generate ATP, the primary energy source for cardiac function. In addition to increased mitochondrial content, simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial respiration. This improvement, evidenced by elevated maximal respiration levels and ATP production, ensures the energy supply necessary for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. These observations highlight the potential of microgravity to promote metabolic maturation in cardiomyocytes, rendering them more functional and suitable for therapeutic applications. Another critical aspect influenced by microgravity is calcium handling, a vital process for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. Cells cultured under microgravity exhibited greater amplitude in calcium transients, reflecting enhanced calcium storage capacity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure crucial for regulating intracellular calcium concentrations. Efficient calcium handling is essential for effective cardiac function, as it enables stronger and more coordinated muscle fiber contractions. These findings indicate that cardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity are not only more metabolically advanced but also display improved functionality consistent with mature cardiomyocytes. Simulated microgravity also positively affects the structural properties of cardiomyocytes. Observations include increased sarcomere length, the functional unit responsible for muscle contraction, and longer Z-disks, key structures for transmitting contraction forces. Additionally, nuclear eccentricity and diameter were increased, further indicating a higher degree of cellular maturation. These structural enhancements bring cardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity closer to the characteristics of fully functional human cardiac cells, reinforcing their ability to perform physiological functions effectively. The duration of exposure to microgravity plays a pivotal role in maximizing these benefits. Recent studies suggest that a 7-day exposure period is optimal for promoting significant improvements in cardiomyocyte maturation. Prolonged exposures of 14 days, however, did not yield additional benefits, indicating a specific time window for maximizing the positive effects of microgravity. Optimizing culture conditions within this timeframe is essential to achieve the best outcomes. Advances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation and functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine, particularly for treating cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions. The ability to produce high-quality, mature cardiomyocytes is critical for developing effective cellular grafts capable of integrating into damaged tissues and restoring cardiac functionality. These breakthroughs represent a significant step forward in biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for the treatment of cardiac pathologies (Figure 3)."

    "Impacts on Stem Cells and Cell Regeneration": {
      "main_content": "Microgravity has provided significant insights into how this environment influences fundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell repair. Research conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial simulations has demonstrated that microgravity impacts protein expression and the regulation of cellular pathways critical for the growth and regeneration of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways affected is the Hippo pathway, which plays a central role in cell proliferation and tissue damage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily deactivated, creating a favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue repair. These effects have shown particular promise in regenerating organs such as the heart, with potential applications extending to other tissues. The replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new possibilities for exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon. Findings suggest that microgravity could serve as a valuable tool for enhancing the regenerative capacity of stem cells without requiring invasive or complex technologies. Additionally, combining microgravity exposure with the use of certain drugs or microRNA manipulationâkey regulators of gene expressionâcan amplify the activity of the Hippo pathway and YAP1 protein, further promoting tissue regeneration. These discoveries hold promise for treating heart diseases and repairing other damaged tissues and systems (Figure 4). Cells cultured under simulated microgravity using an RPM have shown significant alterations, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to gravity loss. For example, thyroid carcinoma cells (FTC-133) formed three-dimensional spheroids, contrasting with their typical monolayer growth, and displayed changes in adhesion properties and internal organization consistent with spaceflight observations. These morphological transformations involved cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly affecting actin filaments and microtubules, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Gene expression analysis revealed changes in genes related to cellular adhesion and proliferation, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), E-cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover, T lymphocytes exposed to RPM-simulated microgravity exhibited decreased activation, mirroring the effects observed in spaceflight experiments. These findings validate the utility of RPMs for ground-based research on physiological changes relevant to long-duration spaceflight.",
      "Hematopoietic Differentiation": "Simulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering a promising avenue for regenerative medicine and cell therapies. Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem cells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable increase in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation processes. Transcriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1. RUNX1 is essential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for maintaining pluripotency and differentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. These gene expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates a favorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis. At the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting the expression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and polymerases. This enhances efficient cell division, a critical factor for hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, microgravity modulates the cell cycle, facilitating transitions through key phases such as G1/S and G2/M, which are essential for cell proliferation. A key discovery is the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which regulates cell growth, survival, and metabolism. This pathway modulates proteins such as mTOR, which governs cell growth and metabolism, and Bad, which inhibits apoptosis, ensuring the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. By promoting cell proliferation and preventing programmed cell death, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of functional hematopoietic cells. Microgravity also enhances three-dimensional cellular organization, improving interactions between cells and their microenvironment. These interactions are vital for forming hematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions more accurately. Cultures in microgravity favor the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which support better differentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis process. This capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models and innovative cell therapies. Microgravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation, proliferation, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural organization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expansion. This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway activation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as BAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity, promoting Î²-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation, activating genes essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch pathway interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic lineage commitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under microgravity alter cell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression, facilitating the three-dimensional organization of hematopoietic clusters. On a physiological level, microgravity-induced metabolic adjustments enhance responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoietic maturation. These findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems to refine cell culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflightâs effects on human hematopoietic function.",
      "Cell Proliferation and Regenerative Therapies": "Microgravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality, representing a transformative advancement for biomedical research and regenerative medicine. In studies with pancreatic islets and neural crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity notably enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For instance, pancreatic beta cells exhibited a 45% increase in proliferation after two weeks of microgravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity conditions. Microgravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific functions. For example, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity showed a significant increase in insulin secretion, suggesting potential applications in developing therapies for metabolic diseases such as diabetes. Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets under microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to create a favorable environment for cell development. The formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is a critical aspect of these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more accurately replicate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex cellâcell and cellâenvironment interactions essential for differentiation, proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D models not only proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as demonstrated by increased insulin secretion. At the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. While further studies are needed to confirm their specific roles in beta cells and neural crest stem cells, these findings underscore microgravityâs ability to influence fundamental processes and optimize cell culture conditions. Microgravity offers a unique environment that enhances cell proliferation, viability, and functionality in 3D models, with direct applications in regenerative medicine. This environment not only promotes cell growth but also improves the functional quality of cells, which can significantly advance the development of cell therapies. For instance, pancreatic islets cultured under microgravity conditions could exhibit superior efficacy in transplants for diabetes patients, demonstrating increased proliferation and functional capacity, which could greatly enhance therapeutic outcomes."

      "Increased Pathogen Virulence and Resistance": "Under microgravity conditions, bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm formation. This is often accompanied by a reduced median lethal dose (LD50) in animal models. For instance, Salmonella Typhimurium cultured under simulated microgravity demonstrated fivefold higher lethality in mice compared to cultures grown under normal gravity. Additionally, these pathogens have been observed to evade and suppress plant innate immunity, enabling colonization of intracellular spaces. While these processes are also observed on Earth, it remains unclear whether microgravity enhances these capabilities or merely facilitates their study.",
      "Molecular Mechanisms Driving Virulence": "Microgravity alters extracellular nutrient transport and activates molecular pathways that enhance bacterial virulence. A key factor is low fluid shear, a physical stimulus that mimics microgravity environments and is also present in human microenvironments such as the gastrointestinal tract. Low fluid shear conditions favor the expression of stress tolerance and virulence-related genes, including those linked to the type III secretion system (TS3) and iron metabolism regulation. For example, Salmonella Typhimurium exposed to microgravity shows increased tolerance to acidic conditions and upregulation of genes controlled by Fur, a critical regulator of iron acquisition and virulence in enteric pathogens.",
      "Effects on Biofilm Formation and Stress Response": "Microgravity also influences the transport of oxygen and phosphates due to the absence of convection, replicating conditions similar to those in human infections. These environmental changes impact gene expression related to stress tolerance and virulence. For instance, Escherichia coli demonstrates enhanced biofilm formation and increased expression of genes responsible for host cell adherence and lesion formation, thereby amplifying its pathogenic potential. However, these effects are not universal; variations in results suggest that the impact of microgravity depends on the pathogen type, culture medium, and specific experimental conditions. A recurring observation across multiple studies is the decreased expression of Hfq, a key regulatory protein involved in stress response and virulence. Hfq plays a critical role in the adaptation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens under stress conditions, including microgravity. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involving Hfq could provide insights into mitigating the risks of pathogen virulence during prolonged space missions. Microgravity significantly affects interactions between human pathogens and plants, increasing bacterial virulence and compromising plant defense mechanisms. For example, pathogens under microgravity conditions demonstrate an enhanced ability to suppress plant immune responses, facilitating colonization and intracellular persistence. These effects underscore the importance of investigating pathogen behavior in extreme conditions to develop strategies that mitigate health risks in space environments."

      "main_content": "Recent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide array of biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration. This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis, liver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and stem cell differentiation, with profound implications for human health, particularly during prolonged space travel . Advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on stem cells, T cells, and immune function have created new opportunities for therapeutic innovations. Alterations in cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes observed in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravityâs potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human physiology in extreme environments. Microgravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing chronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravityâs transformative potential to reshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in space and on Earth. As a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound and multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging conventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces disrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions. Key effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy, and calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene expression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for energy production and cellular health. In the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of mitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented changes in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and nutritional strategies during prolonged missions. Microgravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with applications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug crystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new therapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has contributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space and terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space missions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits. Despite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity underline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars and other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terrestrial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of microgravity and developing effective countermeasures. The study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human body adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implications for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known, this research establishes itself as a cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space exploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health."

      "main_content": "Microgravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, profoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, distinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for human health. Emerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its impact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to infections.

    "Introduction": {
      "main_content": "Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning, despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass, although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies, but not in others, thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceflight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceflight elevates Cdkn1a expression in bone tissue, liver and kidney as well as cultured cells, implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceflight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used thematic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression findings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inflammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceflight."

    "Results": {
      "Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight": "Immediately after landing, all flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were determined to be in good condition by veterinary examination. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the experiment design and workflow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the duration of the experiment was 2.0 g (-9.1%, SD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) whereas GRD control mice lost an average of 0.7 g (-3.4%, SD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096); the difference in body weight loss averages for FLT versus GRD was not significant (p = 0.143). FLT habitats showed an average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats. However, measured values for food and water utilization after flight may not precisely reflect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and water spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats.",
      "Spaceflight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes": "Comparable quantities (average of 38.5 Î¼g RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities of total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress PCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism (Supplementary Table S1), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of Nfe2l2 expression levels (Figure 2). Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a trend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by spaceflight . Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD (p < 0.05) . Specifically, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 (Ptgs2), which acts as peroxidase, was downregulated by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of Nox1 and downregulation of Ptgs2 may reflect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT mice relative to GRD controls. In addition, Txnip was upregulated by 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples. Ncf2, which codes for a component of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates superoxide, was moderately downregulated by spaceflight (-1.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6, Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3) and oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) were moderately affected by spaceflight (1.2-2.4 fold, p < 0.05) . There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2, in FLT compared to GRD animals (Figure 2). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated as a consequence of exposure to the spaceflight environment.",
      "Spaceflight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes": "The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction were analyzed by p53 Signaling Pathway PCR array (Supplementary Table S2). Out of 84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared to GRD controls . Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation were altered due to spaceflight. Specifically, cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkn1a were upregulated 6.8-fold while Cdk1 was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth and proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD. Myc was upregulated 3.9-fold (p < 0.05). Genes involved in inflammatory responses, including Tnf, Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1, were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease, respectively) in spaceflight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair, four genes were modestly upregulated (Atr, Xrcc5, Ercc1, Apex1; 1.1â1.3-fold) . There were no significant changes in apoptosis-related genes including Trp53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2).",
      "Gene Networks and Disease Predictions": "We made use of a computational approach to gain insight into possible proteinâprotein interactions among the differentially expressed genes. Analysis using String Db revealed potential interactions between the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways (Figure 3). A number of oxidative stress response DEGs formed a molecular interaction network including Nox1 and Sod1 with Catalase serving as a central node. DEGs from the Trp53 signaling pathway also formed molecular interaction networks involving cell cycle-related genes and transcription factors. For the Trp53 pathway, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdkn1a and Atr served as central nodes in a molecular network that included Chek2, Fancc, Ercc1, Xrcc5 and Xpa1 among others. Interestingly, the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways were linked by central nodes FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a, all of which code for major transcriptional regulators. This finding suggests global transcriptomic changes in the heart response to spaceflight. We also utilized a computational approach to gain insight into possible disease phenotypes associated with spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression. Functional enrichment analysis of oxidative stress array DEGs using Toppfun revealed enrichment of genes linked to hypertensive disease, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular accident and decompensation (Supplementary Table S3). Using a similar analysis approach, p53 array DEGs revealed potential links to a number of cancers including sarcoma, immune suppression, impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular pathologies including hypertensive disease, acute myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis (Supplementary Table S4)."

    "Discussion": {
      "main_content": "Our findings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Spaceflight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar benefits to rodent studies on Earth. The animals flown in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary examination after return to Earth, and the finding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scientific reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (e.g.,). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid. Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited. Goldstein et al. report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level.",
      "Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart": "RT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) altered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls. In addition, RT-PCR analysis for Nfe2l2 revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD. Nfe2l2 is a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly transcribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector. Other tissues also display reduced Nfe2l2 expression levels in similar spaceflight experiments entailing tissue recovery after landing. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration spaceflight activates Nfe2l2-dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of growing mice. Furthermore, Nfe2l2-deficient mice are protected from spaceflight-induced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight, and also display accelerated transition of muscle fiber type without protecting from atrophy. We also found that spaceflight upregulated Nox1 6.6-fold, the change of greatest magnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly regulated fashion. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide radicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased expression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in the vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction. Several recent studies using ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading causes cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by fractional shortening. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac responses to simulated weightlessness. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that increased expression of Nox1 during spaceflight contributes to oxidative stress and myocardial abnormalities. Oxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of Ptgs2 by 3.4-fold in FLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the key, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression can lead to inefficient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output, decreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that Ptgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and inflammatory heart diseases. In addition to inflammation, the prostaglandin pathway plays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, spaceflight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation to replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for microgravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway. Inhibition of PTGS2 also impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading. Thus, regulation of the prostaglandin pathway by spaceflight via changes in Ptgs2 expression may contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth. Txnip was upregulated 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT compared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during spaceflight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs), which are potent antioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated Txnip expression in FLT samples may lead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC), Txnip was the most upregulated by spaceflight (33-fold). Fancc codes for an antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated damage to tissue. Our results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6, Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) (1.2â2.4-fold, p < 0.05) . The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically significant genes were generally modest, together, the findings suggest that spaceflight activates a network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in the heart.",
      "Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart": "Increased generation of ROS during spaceflight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA damage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction caused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of specific cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive regulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53 Signaling PCR array. The p53 Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Results indicate that nine of these genes were significantly altered in FLT samples. We found spaceflight increased Cdkn1a/p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and muscle. CDKN1A (also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases in p21 levels in bone from mice in this spaceflight experiment spaceflight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21 levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart, though it is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) can account for our findings. More likely, the elevation in p21 caused by spaceflight may contribute to cardiomyopathies via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy and senescence. Interestingly, Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes cardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the spaceflight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21 re-expression in p21-null mice. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21 elevation might interfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during post-natal development. PTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) regulates the cell cycle by inducing cyclin D3 and repressing p21 expression. Thus, a decrease in Pttg1 expression (2.4-fold) observed in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression of p21 in FLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDKâs and cyclins such as Cdk1 and Cdk4 were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest in spaceflight samples. Our results also indicate some apparently contradictory findings, such as the expression levels of genes for cell cycle arrest proteins, Chek2 and Btg2, were decreased 2.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively in FLT samples, contrary to what is expected for Chek2 when Myc is overexpressed based on what is observed in lymphoma cells. Thus, one of the crucial findings of our study is that spaceflight alters the expression levels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist predominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this suggests that spaceflight activates p21- and Myc-related pathways to regulate cell growth, cardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions such as these remain to be elucidated.",
      "Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Hearts": "There were no significant changes in apoptosis-related genes such as p53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2). DNA damage repair genes such as Atr, Xrcc5, Ercc1 and Apex1 were only moderately altered in spaceflight (1.1- to 1.3-fold), suggesting widespread DNA damage responses were not occurring at the time of sample recovery. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that spaceflight activates DNA damage and apoptosis pathways in a smaller sub-population of cell types within the heart during spaceflight, as shown previously for exposure to low dose, heavy ion radiation (16O, 600 MeV/n) simulating space radiation. Evidence supporting the possibility that spaceflight activates DNA damage pathways and/or apoptosis has been reported for tissues other than heart, including the thymus and the eye, and multi-omics analyses reveal increased levels of DNA damage markers in urine and blood from astronauts.",
      "Inflammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart": "Inflammatory response genes, such as Tnf (tumor necrosis factor), Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 (Tnf receptor-associated factor) were significantly downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease) in FLT samples compared to GRD controls. Tnf is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates a wide variety of biological processes such as inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Space is a hazardous environment and proper immune functioning is crucial for astronaut health and success of space missions. The decreased expression of Tnf, Tnfrsf10b and Traf1 observed in our study suggests downregulation of this pro-inflammatory signaling pathway, which may lead to compromised immune function. Our results are consistent with other studies showing spaceflight reduces Tnf expression levels in both mice and humans. In addition, human T cell cultures on the International Space Station (ISS) show a 15-fold decrement in expression of Tnf in T cells and its downstream effectors in microgravity as compared to cells centrifuged at 1g. During a very long duration spaceflight, TNFÎ± expression in the blood of astronauts is elevated but after return to Earth (between days 0 and 5) as skeletal muscle enters a recovery phase, TnfÎ± expression rapidly declines along with other cytokines in the Il6 pathway. Together, these findings implicate a biomechanical, gravity-dependent mechanism for regulating Tnf-related pathways. Although the radiation exposure of mice on the STS-131 mission is considered too low to account for our results, relatively low doses of particle radiation (<30 cGy) can lead to altered regulation of disease-related pathways and deficits in cardiac function. Furthermore, expression of oxidative stress and inflammation markers in the heart caused by low dose gamma radiation exposure is exacerbated when combined with hindlimb unloading. Further study is needed to determine the influence of space radiation in combination with microgravity, on the heart in the spaceflight environment during long duration missions.",
      "Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease": "Computational analysis revealed that changes in a subset of genes that were differentially expressed due to spaceflight were linked to disease, including immune suppression and impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with findings in astronauts. In addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from spaceflight were associated with cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hypertensive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric changes in blood flow were consistent with previous observations in crew members during flight. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial pressures reportedly do not change significantly during spaceflight. However, cardiac output and stroke volume are increased in flight compared to the seated position on Earth (although comparable to the supine position on Earth). Thus, our findings were consistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that spaceflight adversely affects cardiovascular health. Computational analyses also indicated that spaceflight led to altered regulation of molecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation pathways. Our findings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked and that spaceflight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore, transcription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to spaceflight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were predicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceflight. Hence, these molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against spaceflight-induced tissue deficits.",
      "Limitations": "For extrapolation of findings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent limitation of the difference in species as well as a potential influence of the specific strain and sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression findings from this experiment include the fixed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in flight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the flight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely reflect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may reflect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity on Earth, however briefly. As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how spaceflight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with a discrete gene expression profile, future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of specific gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function."

      "Ethics Statement": "All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was NAS-10-002-Y1.",
      "Animals and Spaceflight": "The mice in this study were flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission for the experiment âMouse Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceflightâ. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award to E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to spaceflight food bars and lixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before spaceflight. Mice were divided into two groups: flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered filter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are self-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food and water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then flown in space for 15 days and were not subjected to any experimental procedures during spaceflight. Synchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental conditions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before flight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery. Animals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at a pace of one mouse every 15â20 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed arteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis.",
      "RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis": "Total RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were homogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation, 0.2 mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30 s and then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were separated and incubated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C and the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100 Î¼L of nuclease-free water and further purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions. The quantities and qualities of purified RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on 0.8% agarose formaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor-S Multimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative Stress and p53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (for Nfe2l2). Although whole transcriptome analysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses.",
      "Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array": "An equal amount of RNA (1 Î¼g) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthesize cDNA using RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturerâs protocol (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Briefly, FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed with RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and distributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers for 84 genes related to oxidative stress or p53 signaling pathways and control housekeeping genes (HKG). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95 Â°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 Â°C for 15 s and 60 Â°C for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples were also run on control RT2 RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality, reverse transcription efficiency, PCR efficiency and genomic DNA contamination.",
      "Nfe2l2 Real-Time PCR": "cDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Briefly, 1 Î¼g of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at 42 Â°C for 2 min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer and Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturerâs instruction. The Real-Time PCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green PCR Mix and Nfe2l2 primer mixture, per manufacturerâs protocol. Real-time PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with initial activation at 95 Â°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 Â°C for 15 s and 60 Â°C for 1 min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all the samples.",
      "Data Analysis and Statistics": "For the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method (ÎÎCt) with normalization to the average expression levels of five housekeeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to GRD controls using MannâWhitney U Test using p < 0.05 as the threshold of significance and sample size of n = 4 mice per group. For Nfe2l2 RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated using the ÎÎCt method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) 1 as housekeeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from flight and ground control groups was used in the MannâWhitney U test at p < 0.05, n = 4 mice per group.",
      "Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis": "To generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically significant differentially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein-protein interaction database. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression were used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was set to a threshold of âmediumâ (0.400). Toppfun was used to gain insight into whether the differentially expressed genes were linked to human disease phenotypes. Statistically significant differentially expressed genes were entered into the Toppfun database. The results were filtered using a BenjaminiâHochberg false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of p < 0.05 and a query to genome overlap of four or more genes."

    "Conclusions": {
      "main_content": "In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceflight significantly altered cardiac expression of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notably Cdkn1a/p21, Cdk1, and Myc), inflammation (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2, Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These findings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identification of specific mechanisms and molecules responsible for excess ROS generation during spaceflight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.
